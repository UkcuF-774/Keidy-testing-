            description:'I plan to remake a classroom group project where my teammates and I designed and normalized a relational database from scratch. The original project had three parts: documentation, reading, and technical implementation, and I was mainly in charge of the latter. I helped identify customer needs and business rules, determine entities and their relationships, and create tables that followed those rules. I was responsible for normalizing the tables and relationships, getting the tables up and running in the database, and ensuring all sample queries returned the expected output to confirm the database was set up correctly. This project gave me hands-on experience with creating schemas, defining entity relationships based on the identified business rules, and applying normalization principles to ensure data integrity. By remaking it, I aim to showcase my understanding of database design, best practices for data integrity, and my ability to contribute effectively in a team setting.',

My role included creating endpoints, setting up database tables, and ensuring the server responded correctly to client requests. I also contributed to the frontend by building the main sign-up and sign-in pages. This was my first time working with a backend, so the experience gave me hands-on practice building APIs, creating a relational database outside of the classroom, and collaborating on a codebase I didn’t fully own. It strengthened both my understanding of backend development and my ability to work effectively as part of a team.',
